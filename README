WRITETYPE
Software to help young students write

Installing WriteType (GNU/Linux)
================================

1. Be sure you have the following packages installed:
    - Qt4
    - Python 2.7 or higher
    - PyQt4
    - pyenchant
    - Festival or eSpeak

2. Type "make", followed by "make install".  

3. To uninstall at a later time, type "make uninstall".  


Building Debian Packages
========================

1. Checkout a clean copy from bzr (lp:writetype) and remove the .bzr
directory

2. Dowload the "debian" directory from the Debian VC:
http://packages.qa.debian.org/w/writetype.html

3. Build the package


Building a Windows Installer
============================

1. Checkout a clean copy from bzr (lp:writetype) on a GNU/Linux
computer, run "make", and then copy the resulting directory to a
Windows computer.

2. Edit writetype/main.py to import all local references from the
"writetype" module.  For instance, instead of "import
PlatformSettings", do "from writetype import PlatformSettings"

3. Run "python setup.py py2exe"

4. Go to the "dist" directory and rename "main.exe" to "writetype.exe"

5. Create a new, fresh distribution directory.  Copy the "dist" folder
into it as "bin", and also copy the translation, scripts, res, and
wordlists folders here.

6. Copy platformSettings.windows.ini into the directory as
platformSettings.ini

7. Get a copy of the VC90.CRT files (there should be four) and put
them into a Microsoft.VC90.CRT directory in the bin directory

8. Find a copy of espeak for Windows, and put it into an "espeak"
directory so that espeak.exe can be found at "espeak/espeak.exe"

9. This directory will function as a standalone version.  The
installer can be created by copying install.nis and
FileAssociation.nsh into this directory and compiling them.
